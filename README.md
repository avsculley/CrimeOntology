# Crime Ontology (CrimO)

There will be at least two ontologies available: (1) [BFO](https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO-2020) conformant only; (2) [CCO](https://github.com/CommonCoreOntology/CommonCoreOntologies) conformant.

Both ontologies will use [LMSS](https://github.com/sali-legal/LMSS) and [NIBRS](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/more-fbi-services-and-information/ucr/nibrs)

*__As of June 16, 2023__* The main issue is that LMSS uses a 2012 verson of NIBRS terms, and there exists a 2021 version of NIBRS terms. So, ontologies produced will need to be compatible with both 2012 terms and 2021 terms. Doing this is not trivial. Here are the two relevant documents for comparison.

*__As of July 13, 2023__* Currently there is a plan to focus on the 2021 NIBRS terms since they do not exist in any currently existing ontology.

[NIBRS 2012](https://ucr.fbi.gov/nibrs/2012/resources/nibrs-offense-definitions)

[NIBRS 2021](https://bjs.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh236/files/sarble/data_common/nibrs-user-manual-2021-1041521.pdf)

Any ontologies available on this repo are preliminary works in progress and made available primarily for browsing.
