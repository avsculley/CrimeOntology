# Crime Ontology (CrO)

An ontology of criminal acts and related entities using CCO and BFO.

The ontology is intended to be used to model crime in any jurisdiction. It models international crime and domestic crime. It aims to be as jurisdictionally neutral as possible. That is, it aims to model and define entities without reference to particular definitions found in particular laws, or otherwise according to any particular authority.

The ontology was developed using NIBRS crime classification.
