# Crime Ontology (CrO)

An ontology of criminal acts and related entities using CCO and BFO.

The ontology is intended to used to model crime in any jurisdiction: it models international crime and domestic crime. It aims to be as jurisdictionally neutral as possible: though it models international crime in terms of international law, it models domestic crime without reference to any jurisdiction's legal system.

The ontology was developed using NIBRS crime classification.
