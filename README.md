# Crime Ontology

An ontology of criminal acts and related entities using CCO and BFO.

The ontology is intended to be jurisdiction neutral: it models international crime and domestic crime. And it models kinds of domestic crime without reference to any jurisdiction's legal system.

The ontology was developed using NIBRS crime classification.
